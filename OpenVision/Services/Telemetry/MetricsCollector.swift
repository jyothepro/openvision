// OpenVision - MetricsCollector.swift
// Single entry point for runtime telemetry: marks turn stages, samples device state, fans both
// out to whatever sinks are configured, and keeps a small in-memory history for the debug panel.
//
// Design notes:
//  • Marking is CHEAP and always on — recording a Date costs nothing and means the debug panel is
//    useful the moment you open it. Only device SAMPLING and remote PUSH are opt-in.
//  • Marks are idempotent per stage: the first one wins. Backends emit many partial-response
//    callbacks, and `firstToken` must mean the first, not the latest.
//  • Nothing here may ever carry user content. Numbers, model ids and backend names only.
